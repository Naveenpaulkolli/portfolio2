  <h2>AI Lab Work - Machine Learning Model</h2>
  <p>This project involved building a **machine learning model** to predict customer churn for a company. The goal was to understand customer behavior and reduce churn rates by identifying patterns. The model was trained using **scikit-learn**, and I faced challenges such as **data imbalance**. To address this, I implemented **SMOTE** (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to balance the dataset and improve model accuracy.</p>

  <h2>Reflection on AI Lab Work - Machine Learning Model</h2>
  <p>Creating this machine learning model deepened my understanding of the challenges in real-world AI projects. I learned valuable lessons in **data preprocessing**, especially handling imbalanced datasets, and **algorithm optimization**. By working through these challenges, I gained hands-on experience that will be crucial for my future work in AI/ML. This artifact demonstrates my ability to apply AI/ML techniques to solve practical problems and shows my growth as a developer and data scientist.</p>

  <h2>Artifact 3 - Deep Learning Model for Image Classification</h2>
  <p>This project involved building a **Deep Learning model** using **TensorFlow** to classify images from a large dataset. The model utilized a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to extract features from images, allowing it to categorize them into predefined classes like **cats, dogs, and other animals**. One of the key challenges in this project was optimizing the model's **hyperparameters** to achieve high accuracy while avoiding **overfitting**.</p>
